Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is essential for ensuring the long-term success and scalability of a project. I have broken down the functionality of the program into smaller, reusable modules. Each module has a clear purpose and is responsible for a specific task. This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and debug. I have used descriptive names for variables, functions, and modules that accurately convey their purpose and functionality. This makes the code more readable and self-explanatory. I have written automated tests to verify the correctness of the code and catch regressions when making changes, which ensures that the code meets the requirements and behaves as expected. The CRUD module encapsulates common database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) into reusable functions. This promotes code reuse across different parts of the project. The CRUD module can be reused in other projects that require database interaction. As long as the database schema remains consistent (MongoDB), the CRUD module can be easily integrated into new projects.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically and methodically, utilizing a combination of technical skills, analytical thinking, and problem-solving strategies. When tackling the database or dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, I followed a few key steps.  I carefully reviewed the requirements provided by Grazioso Salvare to gain a clear understanding of their needs and expectations. This involved analyzing the problem domain, identifying key features and functionalities required, and clarifying any ambiguities or uncertainties. Based on the requirements, I devised a plan for designing and implementing the database or dashboard solution. This involved selecting appropriate technologies and frameworks, and outlining the architecture and workflow of the system. I implemented the database or dashboard solution according to the planned design, following best practices and coding standards. Throughout the implementation process, I regularly tested and validated the system to ensure its correctness, reliability, and performance. The Grazioso Salvare project involved addressing mock-real-world needs and requirements of a client, which required a more practical and applied approach compared to purely academic assignments. In the future, to create databases to meet other client requests, I would adopt agile development methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban to facilitate iterative development, frequent client collaboration, and incremental delivery of value.

Computer scientists excel at identifying problems, analyzing them, and devising effective solutions using computational techniques. Their problem-solving skills are critical for addressing a wide range of challenges across industries. They drive innovation by developing new algorithms, tools, and technologies that push the boundaries of what is possible. Their research and development efforts lead to breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, data science, and cybersecurity. As far as the company is concerned, computer scientists can automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes using software and algorithms. Automation increases productivity, reduces errors, and frees up human resources to focus on more creative and strategic tasks. They can also design and implement databases to efficiently manage and organize data related to rescue dogs, shelters, and adoption outcomes. This ensures that relevant information is readily accessible and accurate, enabling informed decision-making.
